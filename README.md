# OpenESC - Open Source Electronic Speed Controller

## Project Overview

**OpenESC** is an open-source Electronic Speed Controller (ESC) project for controlling Brushless DC (BLDC) motors. The goal is to provide a versatile and customizable ESC solution that is free for anyone to use and modify, making it a great alternative to proprietary ESC systems. This project will evolve from a basic open-loop controller to a more advanced closed-loop controller with Back-EMF (BEMF) feedback for improved performance.
